  My edits. Create a strong and memorable first impression with a free one-page business website template, Imagine. 
  This remarkable site canvas has a clean and minimalistic look that will display your content beautifully. 
  Instead of doing the work from the ground up, you can now spice things up immediately with Imagine. 
  It is an HTML template that you will find a breeze to use, thanks to its tidy structure. 
  Keep in mind, the appearance of Imagine works fantastically well by default, but you can tweak it, too.
  It is released under the Creative Commons.
